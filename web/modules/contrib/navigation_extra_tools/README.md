## INTRODUCTION

The Navigation Extra Tools module provides a "Tools" submenu on the new Navigation toolbar with options for clear cache, run cron, and run updates. This performs exactly the same functions as the "Admin Toolbar Extra Tools" submodule of Admin Toolbar..

Admin Toolbar Extra Tools was a useful submodule for providing extra useful functions for site administrators. This functionality is missing from the new Navigation module in Drupal core. This module is designed to provide the same functionality for the new Navigation.

Functions available:

- Clear cache (all caches, or individual caches)
- Run cron
- Run database updates

## REQUIREMENTS

This module requires the core Navigation module to be enabled.

## INSTALLATION

Install as you would normally install a contributed Drupal module.

## CONFIGURATION

No configuration is required.

## IMAGE CREDITS

The module uses the _wrench_ icon from [Phosphor Icons](https://phosphoricons.com/) in keeping with the design of the Navigation Toolbar.

Project logo designed by James Shields using [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/), the open source drawing application, incorporating the Drupal logo and the wrench icon above.
